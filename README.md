## How to get Aadi's part of code running >

1. Download the folder from this branch (should have name Attendify-Aadi)
2. Go to Attendify-Aadi/Attendify-Aadi/screens/LoginPage.js
3. Change the IP address to the wifi network you are using
    since the code is still running local.

   > If you are using Mac, Click on the apple icon located on
   the top left corner of the screen -> Click 'System Settings...'
   -> Click 'Wi-Fi' -> Click 'Details' button next to the network
   you are using -> You will see your network's IP address.
4. Go to line 152 of LoginPage.js and replace the part of string 'localhost' in
   http://localhost:8080/login with the ip address you just got.
   > For example: http://888.88.88.888:8080/login
5. Do the same at line 191 in screens/SignupPage.js
6. Now you still have to connect to the backend first
   before you can run Aadi's code. See below.

## How to render app with Backend running on same device >

1. Download Backend code folder from Powall's or Ishan's branch (should have name
   Attendify-Powall if from Powall's branch)
2. cd to the Backend directory and run **npm install** 
3. If your device is a mac, you need to reinstall bcrypt as you will
   face a compatibility issue as the backend was developed on windows laptops. 
   > Step 1: Run **npm uninstall bcrypt**
   > 
   > Step 2: Then run **npm install bcrypt**
4. Once this is done, you can run the Backend code by running **npm start**
   > To verify your action was successful, you should see log message:
   > 'Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas!'
5. Now, We will get back to the frontend code:
   > Step 1: Open Attendify-Aadi folder in your code editor, make sure you go to the
   > Attendify-Aadi directory inside the Attendify-Aadi folder (They have the same name).
   > You can verify that you are in the right directory by using the 'ls' command,
   > you should see at least 15+ items, not just two.
   >
   > Step 2: Enter **npm install** command, verify you are doing right by checking if
   > a new folder called 'node_modules' is added to the inner Attendify-Aadi folder folder
   >
   > Step 3: Enter **npm start** command, Verify that you are doing well by
   > checking if there is a QR code generated by expo. You can use your camera
   > (iPhone) to scan this code directly or using the 'expo go' app's scanning
   > (Android) to scan this code.
   >
   > Note: If for some reason you get a bunch of errors indicating there is no
   > permission when you are trying to install the packages, something like this:

   > 
   > Use 'sudo npm install' instead. You will
   > have to enter your computer's password after that and everything should
   > work normally.
6. After you have scanned the code, the Attendify app should be rendered in
   the 'expo go' app.
