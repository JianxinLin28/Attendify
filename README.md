# Welcome to my development space
## This branch's source is the "Mobile" branch.
Jianxin Lin (Kolyn090)

## IMPORTANT note
The code in this branch only consists UI components.
Please go to Aadi's branch for more instructions.

**I primary focus on the mobile front end development
of our App - Attendify Student.**
I also have experience with XCode and Swift. Java's Swing GUI framework.
React and React Native is completely new to me. I have not really worked with 
html, css before.

## All planned UI components have been completed
Unless there are suggested changes to be done, I won't be uploading new code from now on.
Of course, I still have to assist my partner to connect them to the backend.
