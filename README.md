# Welcome to the Attendify Mobile front-end development
**Please treat this branch like a main branch.
If you want to contribute, create a new branch and make
its source to this branch!**

Developer: Jianxin Lin & Aadi Deshmukh

## What we are using?
We are using React Native Expo framework to develop & deploy our app!
If you don't have any experience and you want to try out Expo, you can
start by using command:
```
npx create-expo-app --template
```
The command will create an Expo managed project for you, then choose 
the blank templet and name your project. The templet can be the
foundation of your app and it can also be used for quick experiments.
Also, remember to change directory to the newly created folder.

## How to run the app?
If you want to run your app, use command:
```
npm start
```
Expo will generate a QR code, along with many other instructions.
It is highly recommended to use the QR code approach because 
it is easy and has no overhead. To use the QR code, first, download
the "Expo go" App. The app can be found in both Apple Store and Google Play.
Second, use your camera to scan the QR code. You will be redirected to
"Expo go" and your project will be opened on your phone.

Of course, you can use the mobile simulators too. There are only two you need to know.
Pressing 'i' will open an iOS simulator. Pressing 'a' will open an Android simulator. 

## Installing our project
Download the project as a zip file and unzip it. Change directory to the unzip folder,
then run the app by following the above instruction "How to run the app?"
