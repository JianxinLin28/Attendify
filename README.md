## To run the instructor web frontend code locally

* Step 1:
  Download the code in this branch and unzip the file

* Step 2:
  After unzipping, run npm install to install the node modules from the package manager npm

* Step 3:
  Since certain libraries work differently based on OS, downloading the node modules will not be enough. Write down each of the commands below in the terminal window.

  ```
  npm i qrcode
  npm i axios
  npm install @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
  npm i react-router-dom
  ```
* Step 4:
