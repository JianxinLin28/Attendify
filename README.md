## -> If this is the first time you are using React Native Expo
### Get a hang of React Native Expo
We are using React Native Expo framework to develop & deploy our app!
If you don't have any experience with it, we recommend you to try it
out before installing our project. 
* Step 1:
Open VSCode or any IDE you like, and open the terminal from there
and enter this command:
```
npx create-expo-app --template
```
The command will create an Expo managed project for you, then choose 
the blank templet and name your project. The templet can be the
foundation of your app and it can also be used for quick experiments.
Also, remember to change directory to the newly created folder.

* Step 2:
Run the app by using command:
```
npm start
```
Expo will generate a QR code, along with many other instructions.
It is highly recommended to use the QR code approach because 
it is easy and has no overhead. To use the QR code, first, download
the "Expo go" App. The app can be found in both Apple Store and Google Play.
Second, use your camera to scan the QR code. You will be redirected to
"Expo go" and your project will be opened on your phone.

* Step 3 (optional):
Run with simulators

Of course, you can use the mobile simulators too. 
Pressing 'i' will open an iOS simulator. The iOS device by default is iPhone 6s, 
which you might want to change to something else. Use 'shift' + 'i' to choose a 
simulator device. I highly suggest you to download as few as possible since each 
one of them exceeds 6GB. If you want to test on android environment. Please refer 
to the 'Testing on an Android emulator' section on this Readme page.

### Installing our project

To install our app, we have listed 13 steps for you to follow.
You can also follow the steps in this video link made by Mr.Aadi:
[Video placeholder]

* Step 1: Download the project from this branch as a zip file and unzip it. 

* Step 2: Open the unzipped folder in VSCode or any IDE you like.

* Step 3: Change the IP address to the wifi network you are using 
since the code is still running local.
> Hint: If you are using Mac, Click on the apple icon located on
> the top left corner of the screen -> Click 'System Settings...'
> -> Click 'Wi-Fi' -> Click 'Details' button next to the network
> you are using -> You will see your network's IP address.

* Step 4: Go to line 149 of screens/LoginPage.js and replace the part of string 'localhost' in
   http://localhost:8080/login with the ip address you just got.
> For example: http://888.88.88.888:8080/login

* Step 5: Do the same at line 194 in screens/SignupPage.js
   
* Step 6: Enter **npm install** command 
> Hint: Verify you are doing the steps right by checking if a new folder called
> 'node_modules' is added to unzipped folder.

* Step 7: Enter **npm start** command

If you have not already done so, please download the 'Expo go' app from Google Play Store
(Android) or Apple Store (iOS). 
> Hint: Verify you are doing the steps right by checking if there is a QR code
> generated by expo. You can use your camera (iPhone) to scan this code directly
> or use the 'expo go' app's scanning (Android) to scan this code.
>
> Note: If for some reason you get a bunch of errors indicating there is no
> permission when you are trying to install the packages, something like this:

> 
> Solution: Use 'sudo npm install' instead. You will
> have to enter your computer's password after that and everything should
> work normally.

* Step 8: Render the Attendify mobile app on your phone

If you have not already done so, please download the 'Expo go' app from Google Play Store
(Android) or Apple Store (iOS). 

After you have scanned the QR code, your device will redirect the current app to Expo go
and Attendify will be starting to rendered. After the downloading process is done, you should
be in the Login page. However, this app will not functioning correctly for now because you
still have to set up the backend.

* Step 9: Installing the Backend

Download Backend code folder from Powall's or Ishan's branch (i.e. the folder should have name
Attendify-Powall if downloaded from Powall's branch)

* Step 10: Open the folder and install the packages

Open a new window from your IDE and open the Backend folder you just unzipped.
cd to the Backend directory and run **npm install** 
> Hint: Again, verify you are doing the steps right by checking if a new folder called
> 'node_modules' is added to unzipped folder.

* Step 11: Resolve bcrypt bug on Mac

If your device is a mac, you need to reinstall bcrypt as you will
face a compatibility issue as the backend was developed on windows laptops. 
> Step 1: Run **npm uninstall bcrypt**
> 
> Step 2: Then run **npm install bcrypt**

* Step 12: Start the Backend code

Once this is done, you can run the Backend code by running **npm start**
> To verify your action was successful, you should see log message:
> 'Successfully connected to MongoDB Atlas!'

* Step 13: Run the app

After you have set up both frontend & backend. 
Now you should be able to Log in/Sign up and do everything in the app.

### Uploading to sub-branches
Remember, whenever you upload a project, **delete the node_modules file**.
Also, **delete the ios file and android file** if there is any. They are huge!
**Do not** directly upload to other people's branch without their permission.

### Can I see the UI design?
Sure, We are mostly following the interface designs from this Figma page:
https://www.figma.com/file/l5uew2GAntMmYJgnwMoHcD/Attendify-Student?type=design&node-id=1669%3A162202&mode=design&t=CWdsPYv5Xxg4tlXk-1

However, some pages are not shown in the Figma page. Please refer the UI designs in the 
app as the final version.

### Screen navigations in the app
For screen navigations, we are using the stack navigator library by React Native.
Tutorial I wrote:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_EzUmDY-dMop2H4Ky1Bvnebc8gwR2QuCnwDDyu6vWHQ/edit?usp=sharing

### Project UI structure (Navigation)
First of all, everything originates from App() function in the App.js file. 
(Very) general structure
```
<NavigationContainer>
   <Stack.Navigator>
      <Stack.Screen login page>
      <Stack.Screen signup page>
      <Stack.Screen bottom tab>

<Stack.Screen bottom tab>
   <Tab.Navigator>
      <Tab.Screen bluetooth page>
      <Tab.Screen camera page>
      <Tab.Screen course page>
      <Tab.Screen clicker page>
      <Tab.Screen profile page>
```
There is only one Navigation Container across the entire app.
Inside of it, there is navigator. We have two navigators here: Stack and Tab.
Notice that Tab is a nested navigator of Stack. (inside of Stack)
The Tab is also equivalent to 'bottom tab'. If you have took a look on my
figma design, you will know what I mean. I decided to put the bottom tab 
as a "page" of the main Stack because it seems to be easier to manage in
this way. The login page and the signup page do not have bottom tab. 

### Page code structure
Each complete page code should have one to three sections.

Section 1: Internal logic functions, here we handle all interactions between UI components

Coder: Jianxin
```
/* Internal logic code start */
/* Internal logic code end */
```

Section 2: Backend logic connection functions, here is all the connections to the backend

Coder: Aadi
```
/* Connect to backend logic code start */
/* Connect to backend logic code end */
```

Section 3: UI functions, here contains all functional UI components

Coder: Jianxin
```
/* User interface code start */
/* User interface code end */
```

### Coding practice
1. Always including things in a SafeAreaView. This makes sure the app looks good on
every iOS devices.
2. Be sure all your logs can be disabled in some way.
3. Name all your folders starting with a lower case letter, i.e. **stardewValley**
4. Name all js and ts files with the Pascal Case style, i.e. **MyDude.js**
5. For system generated files, please leave it as it is.
6. The use of StyleSheet: for each page, please make it its own file,
   and concentrate styles as much as possible. Also, please ensure you
   only use color from the defined colors in AppTheme.js
8. Your Component functions all start with capital letters!
9. Almost all other functions start with lower letters!
10. We will not be using ts because the tsconfig file is causing trouble
   with the Android emulator (Android Studio).

### Terminology
1. Don't use 'class', instead, use 'course'
2. Although the standard way for RN to describe a page is 'screen', we use 'page' to refer them.

## Troubleshooting
### Asset bundle works on an iOS simulator but not a real iOS device
This issue could happen due to various reasons. The one bothered me was my naming
of file path. You should not include space in any file that is in the path of your
project. So, instead of "CS 320", name it to "CS_320".

### My custom font does not work on a real iOS device
We discourage you to add other custom fonts to this project.
The configuation of a new font can be tedious and I do not intend to add others.
The main reason being Apple is using the font family name and Android is using the file
name. 

### The expo QR code says 'Go to localhost'
This means that you are currently not using expo to test your app.
You should enter 's' key to switch the development environment to expo.
You will notice the QR code will change and it should work after that.

### Why the camera is black on my simulator
You should not test the camera scanning ability on a simulator.
It simply will not work because the simulator is not built for this.
Use a real device instead. Please refer to 'How to run the app' section
for testing on a real device.

## Deploy to iOS
This following steps will only work if you have XCode. 
[Warning: XCode is very large]
1. Run this command in the project directory
   ```
   npx expo run:ios
   ```
   This will create an iOS folder for the app. If the project already has it you
   don't have to run this command.
2. Open the iOS folder in XCode. If you have not worked with XCode before, start
   by creating an developer account using your Apple Store account.
3. Allow 'Developer Mode' on your iPhone by going to 'Setting -> Privacy & Security
   -> Developer Mode'. Turn on the developer mode, but remember **your iOS device
   might be vunlnerable to certain attacks if this mode is opened**. Your iOS device
   will be forced to restart and you will be asked to turn on developer mode.
4. With 'Developer Mode', you will be allowed to create a _real App_ on your iOS device.
   This is very similar to using Swift and Object-C. First, you need to connect your mobile
   device to your Mac via a USB cable. Your mobile device will be asked to trust your Mac.
   Second, in XCode, select your simulator device to your device (not a simulator).
   Third, click the run button in XCode to run the App. After these three steps, a real app
   will be created. Before opening it, you need to trust yourself on your mobile device.
   To do that, go to "Setting -> General -> VPN&Device Management" and trust Attendify.
5. Now you can open the app. With this approach, your app will have absolutely zero overhead
   and it is equivalent to the Apps deployed in App Store.

## Testing on an Android emulator
Emulators are hardware dependent! They work by emulating an entire device on your laptop.
First of all, start by downloading Android Studio from:
https://developer.android.com/studio. Click 'Download Android Studio Giraffe' button and 
select the version match to your device, I am using a Mac intel chip. 

After you downloaded Android Studio (1.28GB for me). You should launch the wizard and it will
ask you to download a series of things, one of them is the emulator. Please download them.
Then, open Android Studio, in its welcome page, click the three dots next to the 'Get
from VCS' button. You will see 'Virtual Device Manager', click it and you should see a 
device (mine is named Pixel_3a_API_34_extension_level_7_x86_64). Click the play button and
the device will launch. You do not have to open the project in Android Studio, in fact,
that is useless. I use Android Studio purely for the emulator.

Head back to VScode and open your project & direct to the correct root and open the terminal Type:
```
npm start
```
then press 'shift + a'. You should see your android emulator device. 
Select it and press 'enter'. Expo go will be downloaded into the device and 
the project will be launched after the installation is done.

## Re-render going-back-to page
Sometimes, you might find youself want to re-render the page that you are going back to.
Let's say you have a page A, and it can go to page B. You modified something in page B,
now you want to go back to page A and you expect some changes to be reflected on page A. 
If you did things normally, you will find out nothing has changed in page A.
To solve this, you need to do these steps to page A:


Step 1: 
Define the 'useState' variables you want to use, they are variables that updates
visually when changed.


Step 2:
Add this to your page function:
```
React.useEffect(() => {
    const unsubscribe = navigation.addListener('focus', () => {
      // change state variable
    });
    return () => unsubscribe();
  }, [navigation]);
```
Now Your page A should reflect the changes made from page B.
