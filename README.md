# Welcome to my development space
Jianxin Lin (Kolyn090)

**I primary focus on the mobile front end development
of our App - Attendify Student.**
I also have experience with XCode and Swift. Java's Swing GUI framework.
React and React Native is completely new to me. I have not really worked with 
html, css before so this project can be quite challenging to me.

## Things to do:
1. Design a register page
2. Code a bottom-tab navigator
3. Code the 'open camera' pages
